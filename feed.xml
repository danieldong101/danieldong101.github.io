<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Direct Connection
Connecting to EC2 instance in VPC
Connecting using AWS SSM (Session Manager)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Direct Connection</p>

<p>Before starting you should:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Have WinSCP installed;
Have Amazon EC2 instance running;
Have enabled inbound SSH traffic from your IP address to your instance;
Have your key pair ready;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Collect information about your EC2 instance:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Host name: Check Public DNS column on Instances page of Amazon EC2 console. Note that the public DNS may change when instance is restarted.
Host key fingerprint: On the first connect you will be prompted to verify server host key.
    To securely acquire a fingerprint of the host key, use EC2 web-based terminal. Go to Actions &gt; Connect &gt; EC2 Instance Connect &gt; Connect on Instances page of Amazon EC2 console. In the terminal, use ssh-keygen command to display a fingerprint of any number of host keys algorithms. The following example shows SHA-256 and MD5 fingerprints of Ed25519 hostkey:

    sudo ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
    sudo ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key -E md5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Start WinSCP. Login dialog will appear. On the dialog:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Make sure New site node is selected.
On New site node, make sure SFTP protocol is selected.
Enter your EC2 instance public DSN name (see above) into Host name box.
User name differs with instance type:
    For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is ec2-user.
    For a RHEL5 AMI, the user name is either root or ec2-user.
    For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is ubuntu.
    For an Centos AMI, the user name is centos.
    For a Fedora AMI, the user name is either fedora or ec2-user.
    For SUSE Linux, the user name is root or ec2-user.
Press Advanced button to open Advanced site settings dialog and go to SSH &gt; Authentication page.
In Private key file box select the .pem private key file. WinSCP will need to convert the key to its .ppk format (you can then use the converted .ppk key for example with PuTTY SSH client).
Submit Advanced site settings dialog with OK button.
Save your site settings using Save button.



Login using Login button.
Verify the host key by comparing fingerprints with those collected before (see above).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are managing a large amount of servers, and it is not feasible for you to save a site for each of them in WinSCP, consider using the user script Injecting SFTP or FTP URL to a page (Amazon EC2 management console).
Connecting to EC2 instance in VPC</p>

<p>To connect to an EC2 instance in an Amazon VPC, you can tunnel through a NAT instance.</p>

<p>For details, see Connect to FTP/SFTP server which can be accessed via another server only.
Connecting using AWS SSM (Session Manager)</p>

<p>In Host name, specify your Instance ID.</p>

<p>Press Advanced button to open Advanced site settings dialog and go to Connection &gt; Proxy page. There:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>For Proxy type, select Local.
In Local proxy command, specify:

aws ssm start-session --target %host --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters "portNumber=%port" --profile &lt;aws profile&gt; --region &lt;region&gt;

You may need to set Do DNS name lookup at proxy end to Yes.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>

<p>As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.</p>

<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>

<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>strike through</del></li>
  <li>==highlight==</li>
  <li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>

<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/8.jpg" alt="walking" /></p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Tree of Codes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tree of Codes" /><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes/"><![CDATA[<p>The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>]]></content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet.
